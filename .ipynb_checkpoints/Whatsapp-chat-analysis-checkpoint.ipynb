As enjoyable it may seem, we regret to inform you all that we will have CA1 exams just on our 2nd week of offline classes, that means the week from 4-8 April. Since there will be very little time to cover syllabus and all, for the maths CA exam, you need to study basic probability that we had in classes 11-12. No high level skills required, just brush up the old topics in these 2-3 days. Sayani ma'am will be taking our maths class in sem 2 and she will start with conditional probability since time is very less. So it would be helpful if you have basics prepared. As for those who are not coming on the first week, you have to figure things out on your own.\n",

      " My friends, I have a small proposal. A few days ago I was in the staff room and overheard a conversation between Soumik Sir and the other teachers of our department. Soumik Sir was really sad to see that we didn't seem interested in a department picnic, he felt like we had let him down, especially after all that he has done for us. It is true, our department has always been very lenient with us and has always treated us well. However, you might have realised how things have changed recently with the department being more strict and rigid than usual. I am sure you all know how bad it is in the other departments like CSE and IT. We really wouldn't want that to happen to our department, especially when the semester examination and placements are around the corner and being the first batch of CSE-AIML we should also make sure that we are the most memorable batch also. \n",

You cannot change the data after this temporary submission.\\n\\nThe final submission is a complete work of a student. We shall sort the entries of data submission for a tally.
